# 6.179

This repository contains code that executes generalized breadth-first search in C++. search.h contains generalized breadth-first search, as well as a search node class and path class that allow for application of this search code to any domain. mapSearch.cpp contains a sample application of this search code, applying it to a simple 2D grid search. The mapInput files contain sample inputs to execute on the mapSearch file.

This code was completed for the final project in 6.179 (Intro to C/C++) for IAP 2018.
